# MalwareScanner
This malware scanner is a java project I created alongside fellow data structures students in order to understand and practically implement substring search algorithms. For this particular project, we created a malware scanner utilizing available malware hashes on the internet alongside Boyer Moore's substring search algorithm.

MD5.java - Java program to generate MD5 checksum for files. Main code taken from GeeksForGeeks with slight adjustments to allow it to work alongside the BoyerMoore algorithm.

Main.java - Main executable code. Stores database all into one line, scans pre-existing file to see if it has a matching substring. Deletes the file if it matches within the substring, otherwise, the program will leave the file as is.

BoyerMoore.java - Substring search algorithm taken from the algs4 textbook. To see a greater in depth look at the intricacies of this algorithm, this Youtube video is very helpful: youtube.com/watch?v=PHXAOKQk2dw.
